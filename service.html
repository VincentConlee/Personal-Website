    <h1>Community Service</h1>
    <h4>Not the punishment kind</h4>
    <p>
        Back in high school I was a member of the National Honor Society (NHS). As vice president, I had a larger list of responsibilities,
        including organizing community service events and tutoring fellow students. I found NHS to be a rewarding experience that allowed me
        to serve the community and grow closer with my peers.
