    <h1>Technical Skills and Projects</h1>
    <h4>Check out my resume below!</h4>
    <p>
        I have been a student at Texas A&M University since 2023, and I am
        currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
        I have maintained a strong academic record while balancing my extracurricular activities, such as clubs like
        Obstacle Course Racing and Karura.
        I have broad experience in numerous programming languages, including but not limited to Rust, C++,
        Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, as well as plenty of developer tools such as Git, Docker, CoPilot, Vim, and
        WSL.
        I have also used numerous Operating systems and have experience developing in Windows with Powershell, Mac with
        ZShell, and
        various Linux distributions with bash. 
        I installed a dual boot on my desktop pc at home that partitions the drive into Windows and Linux Mint. 
        I also developed my own GUI using the Iced crate from Rust. The project as a whole taught me a lot about safe programming
        and using open source software with little documentation. It also taught me how to debug my code effectively, as well 
        as how to set up a GUI architecture known as Elm Architecture. 
        <br>
        As for my technical interests, I have recently developed a strong interest in embedded systems and system design
        which has led
        me to learn Rust and C++ and join a competitive rover team named Karura. In Karura I am learning to use
        different open source
        softwares in order to contribute to the development of our rover, such as ROS2, CFs, and RACS2. After this, I
        want to pursue
        knowledge towards AI and learn how to develop my own models and create new AI applications using open source
        software such as PyTorch
        or Tensorflow, as well as Nvidia's GPU's with their Cuda language. I have already started researching the AI
        software landscape, but
        as of right now school and Karura are my main priorities.
