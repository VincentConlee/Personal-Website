    <h1>Technical Skills and Projects</h1>
    <h4>Check out my resume below!</h4>
    <p>
        I have been a student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu">Texas A&M University</a> since 2023, and I am
        currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science.
        I have maintained a strong academic record while balancing my extracurricular activities, such as clubs like
        <a href=https://www.instagram.com/tamuocr/?hl>Obstacle Course Racing</a> and Karura.
        I have broad experience in numerous programming languages, including but not limited to Rust, C++,
        Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, as well as plenty of developer tools such as Git, Docker, CoPilot, Vim, and
        WSL.
        I have also used numerous Operating systems and have experience developing in Windows with Powershell, Mac with
        ZShell, and
        various Linux distributions with bash. 
        I installed a dual boot on my desktop pc at home that partitions the drive into Windows and Linux Mint. 
        I also developed my own GUI using the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/iced">Iced</a> crate from Rust. The project as a whole taught me a lot about safe programming
        and using open source software with little documentation. It also taught me how to debug my code effectively, as well 
        as how to set up a GUI architecture known as Elm Architecture. 
        <br>
        As for my technical interests, I have recently developed a strong interest in embedded systems and system design
        which has led
        me to learn Rust and C++ and join a competitive rover team named Karura. In Karura I am learning to use
        different open source
        softwares in order to contribute to the development of our rover, such as <a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html">ROS2</a>, <a href="https://cfengine.com/">CFs</a>, and <a href="https://www.racs2.org/">RACS2</a>. After this, I
        want to pursue
        knowledge towards AI and learn how to develop my own models and create new AI applications using open source
        software such as <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>
        or Tensorflow, as well as Nvidia's GPU's with their Cuda language. I have already started researching the AI
        software landscape, but
        as of right now school and Karura are my main priorities.
