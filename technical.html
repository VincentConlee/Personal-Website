        <h4>Check out my resume below!</h4>
        <p>
            I have broad experience in numerous programming languages, including but not linited to Rust, C++,
            Python, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, as well as plenty of developer tools such as Git, Docker, CoPilot, Vim, and WSL.
            I have also used numerous Operating systems and have experience developing in Windows with Powershell, Mac with ZShell, and 
            various Linux distributions with bash. 
            <br>
            As for my technical interests, I have recently developed a strong interest in embedded systems and system design which has led 
            me to learn Rust and C++ and join a competitive rover team named Karura. In Karura I am learning to use different open source 
            softwares in order to contribute to the development of our rover, such as ROS2, CFs, and RACS2. After this, I want to pursue 
            knowledge towards AI and learn how to develop my own models and create new AI applications.
